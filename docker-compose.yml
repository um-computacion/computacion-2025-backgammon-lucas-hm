    # This tells Docker Compose to build the image using the Dockerfile 
    # located in the current directory (.).
    build: . 
    # Gives the running container a friendly name
    container_name: backgammon_game
    # Automatically removes the container when it exits (useful for testing)
    # If your game is interactive, you might need stdin_open: true and tty: true
    stdin_open: true # Keeps standard input open
    tty: true        # Allocates a pseudo-TTY

    # If your game was a web service, you'd map a port here:
    # ports:
    #   - "8080:8080"
